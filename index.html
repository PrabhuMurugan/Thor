<h2>
Thor was a mighty hero....he is demi god.Show More Thor is the Norse God of Thunder. He is also a Deity of lightning, storms, Oak trees, farmers, fertility, strength, destruction, healing and death. Thor is also a protector of mankind and is very loyal to his father Odin and the Aesir Gods. In the past, he came to their defence any time it was needed, no matter how far away he was or what else he was doing. His family always comes first.

Thor is the son of Odin and a Giantess. Thor is connected with both the Earth and the sky due to his parents, the sky through his father and the Earth through his mother. He is one of the Aesir Gods and is considered one of the strongest amongst them.</h2>

<p> Thor and his hammer. Basing his calculations on the density of neutron stars, he figured that Thor’s hammer should weigh more than 300 billion elephants. Interesting to think about, but wrong. Looking to the canon encased in surely mint-condition comics, other Thor enthusiasts noted that Thor’s hammer, Mjolnir, is about 42 pounds. Not quite a legion of elephants compressed into a block, but you still wouldn’t want to get hit in the face with it. Just ask an ice giant.

But if we should look to the original comics to settle the question of Mjolnir’s mass, both sides are technically correct—the hammer is simultaneously incredibly massive and light enough to hold.

James Kakalios, author of The Physics of Superheroes, is kind of the go-to guy when it comes to science in comic books. Like the rest of us nerds, he had his own ideas about the mass of Thor’s hammer, now immortalized in the actual comics. Informed by Kakalios and delivered by Hulk’s alter ego Bruce Banner, Marvel comics’ Indestructible Hulk No. 8 tells us that Thor’s hammer can effectively change its mass by emitting graviton particles. By changing gravity around itself, the hammer can both be light enough for Thor to swing and too heavy for enemies to lift from the floor (thanks to identification nanotechonolgy, no less). This is also why in The Avengers Hulk cannot lift the hammer even though he can sprint through an aircraft carrier. Of course, if you don’t buy the graviton argument, the comic and Kakalios offer another—magic. Get over it.</p>

<h3>
At the very moment when Odin faded away from the midgard ( earth) we could notice that there was some lightning energy on Thor's hand emerging which means as Thor had become the King of Asgard automatically he gets the contact with the Odin force . When he gets his stormbreaker in the movie Infinity war he gets his full power as a king of Asgard. Thor's present power is unparalleled to other avengers . He can do teleportation , energy blasts , matter manipulation and a lot more . Odin who had the Odin force before can even destroy a Galaxy or go toe to toe with cosmic entity like Galactus

<h1 style="color:black;background-color:red;text-align:center;">Thor an immortal Demi God<h1>
<p><h2>No, Thor being immortal is a very common misconception. He as well as any other Asgardian do die eventually.
Loki stated in 2013’s Thor: The Dark World that Asgardians do have extended lifespans of a few thousand years, but that’s still far from actual immortality.
According the marvel wiki, even in the comics, Thor isn’t immortal, but rather have a extended lifespan like in the MCU. He ages so slowly that humans might perceive it as immortality. In addition, Thor consumes the Golden Apples cultivated by Idunn, which allows Thor to live longer.
In the end, Thor himself is not immortal. He has an extended lifespan and relies on the Golden Apples to make himself live longer.</h2></p>
